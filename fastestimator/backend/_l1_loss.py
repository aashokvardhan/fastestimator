    This method can be used with PyTorch tensors:
    ```python

    true = torch.tensor([[0,1,0,0], [0,0,0,1], [0,0,1,0], [1,0,0,0]])
    pred = torch.tensor([[0.1,0.9,0.05,0.05], [0.1,0.2,0.0,0.7], [0.0,0.15,0.8,0.05], [1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]])

    ```

    Args:
        y_true: Ground truth class labels with a shape like (batch) or (batch, n_classes). dtype: int, float16, float32.
        y_pred: Prediction score for each class, with a shape like y_true. dtype: float32 or float16.

    Returns:
        The L1 loss between `y_true` and `y_pred`.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `y_pred` is an unacceptable data type.
